# Cigarette SMOKING remains a major risk factor for stroke, nearly doubling the risk with a dose response relationship between pack-years and stroke risk. Second hand smoke has been identified as an independent risk factor for stroke in the REGARDS cohort, with the risk of stroke increasing 30% after accounting for other stroke risk factors, for those who have been exposed to second hand smoke versus those who have not been exposed. If you smoke 20 cigarettes a day, you are six times more likely to have a stroke compared to a non-smoker. 

Because nicotine is so addictive and the smoking habit becomes so automatic, many people need support to help them stop smoking. There are several different types of medicine and stop-smoking aids to help. Refer to your physician or advisor to know which type of treatment is most suitable.
