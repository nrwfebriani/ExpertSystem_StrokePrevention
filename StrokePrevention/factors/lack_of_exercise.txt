# PHYSICAL INACTIVITY is associated with many poor health effects, including stroke. People who are physically active have a lower risk of stroke and stroke mortality than those who are inactive. The relationship between physical activity and stroke may be due to the associated decrease in blood pressure, reduction in diabetes, and reduction in excess body weight. 

It is recommended to take 3.5 hours per week of moderate activity to reduce stroke risks.
