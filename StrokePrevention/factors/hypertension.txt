# HYPERTENSION is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke, with a strong, direct, linear, and continuous relationship between blood pressure and stroke risk. Even among those who are not defined as hypertensive, the higher the blood pressure, the higher the risk of stroke. 

Lifestyle changes such as reducing the amount of salt in your diet, losing weight if you're overweight, exercising regularly, as well as cutting back on alcohol, caffeine, and cigarette can help reduce the blood pressure. Some people may also need to take medicines if deemed necessary by their physician to stop their blood pressure from getting too high. The normal blood pressure category is <120/80 but this may vary depends on age, gender, etc.
